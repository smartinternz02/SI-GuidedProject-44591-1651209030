Expense Tracker App
In todayâ€™s busy and expensive life we are in a great rush to make money. But at the end of the month, we broke off. As we are unknowingly spending money on little and 
unwanted things. So, we have come over with the idea to track our earnings. The daily expense tracker aims to help everyone who is planning to know their expenses and 
save from it. An expense tracker is a spring boot app that users can access from URL and update their daily expenses so that they are well known for their expenses.
Here users can choose categories for expense types like food, clothing, rent, and bills where they have to enter the money that has been spent and also can add some 
information in additional information to specify the expense. Users will be able to see graphs of expenses. Users can save those graphs for their own reference.  


Purpose of the project:
The aim of this project is to build an efficient digitized budget tracking system, which would be essential for tracking and visualizing the expenditures. 
The access to several categories in the applications enables to separate the expenses accordingly, which can further be used to reduce the same. 
Graphs provided in the application enables improved visualization of expenditures. 
An expense tracker is a software or application that helps to keep an accurate record of your money inflow and outflow. Many people in India live on a fixed income, and they find that towards the end of the month they don't have sufficient money to meet their needs.
When you track your spending, you know where your money goes and you can ensure that your money is used wisely. Tracking your expenditures also allows you to understand why you're in debt and how you got there. This will then help you design a befitting strategy of getting out of debt.
